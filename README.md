# Wine Quality Project
Use multiple machine learning algorithms to predict the wine quality.

Team Members: Tian (Luke) Qi, Ran Huang, Randy Ma, Anna Zeng.

## Goal
This project is the final project of MSDS621 Introduction to Machine Learning. In this project we used Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier to predict wine quality. In the presentation slides, we showed our models' performance on the test data.

The learning outcome of this project is to understand the concept of some machine learning algorithms and implementation of them.

## Description of Data
The dataset we will be analyzing in this study is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)

The data includes information about red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal, with their 11 features: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol.

## Presentation Slides
The presentation slides shows the complete workflow of the project.
